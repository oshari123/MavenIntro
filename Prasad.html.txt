=======================================
Apache Maven:

Maven's primary goal is to allow a developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time. In order to attain this goal, Maven deals with several areas of concern:

Making the build process easy
Providing a uniform build system
Providing quality project information
Encouraging better development practices

=======================================

While using Maven doesn't eliminate the need to know about the underlying mechanisms, Maven does shield developers from many details.
